# Ring Racers Battle Alert
This is a Java application that periodically checks Ring Racer's [server browser](https://ms.kartkrew.org/) to check for battle servers.
If any are available, it will ping them to check roughly how bad the delay would be in-game. It can also play a really loud alarm sound when it finds one.

I made this because I really like battle and it is rare for a battle server to be active in a region I have good latency on.

## Usage
- Download and install Java 17. I would recommend [this](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17) site.
- Open command prompt in the directory where the .jar is, and launch it using `java -jar (the jar's name)`. Or maybe double clicking it works for you. It doesn't for me!

## TODO
- Figure out why some servers don't respond to pings
- Maybe add more filters so this could be used for more than just battle
- Maybe add saving settings
